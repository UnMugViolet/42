## üìñ Introduction
The **Philosophers** project is part of the 42 curriculum and is designed to introduce students to the concepts of **multithreading**, **synchronization**, and **deadlock prevention**. It simulates the famous "Dining Philosophers Problem," a classic problem in computer science that explores resource sharing and concurrency.

## üçΩÔ∏è The Dining Philosophers Problem
Imagine five philosophers sitting around a circular table. Each philosopher alternates between three states:
- **Thinking** üß†
- **Eating** üçù
- **Sleeping** üõå

To eat, a philosopher needs two forks (one on their left and one on their right). However, there are only five forks available, one between each pair of philosophers. This creates a challenge: how can the philosophers eat without causing a deadlock or starvation?

---

## üìú Rules of the Simulation
1. **Philosophers' Actions**:
   - A philosopher can **think**, **take forks**, **eat**, or **sleep**.
   - To eat, a philosopher must pick up both forks (left and right).

2. **Simulation Parameters**:
   - `number_of_philosophers`: Total number of philosophers (and forks).
   - `time_to_die`: Time (in ms) a philosopher can live without eating.
   - `time_to_eat`: Time (in ms) it takes for a philosopher to eat.
   - `time_to_sleep`: Time (in ms) a philosopher spends sleeping.
   - `[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]` (optional): If provided, the simulation stops when all philosophers have eaten this many times.


3. **Parameters Rules**:
   - The `number_of_philosophers` must not exceed 200.
   - All the `times` values must not be bellow 60 ms.
   - All the arguments given to the program must be strictly positive and numeric values.

4. **Philosopher Death**:
   - If a philosopher does not eat within `time_to_die`, they die, and the simulation ends. The message must be displayed within 10 ms after a philo dies. _(first argument in the printed message)_

5. **No Deadlocks**:
   - The program must ensure that no deadlocks occur during the simulation.

6. **No Data Races**
	- Ensure that the thread accessing a data does not conflict with another thread.

## üíª Program Usage
### Compilation
To compile the program, run:
```bash
make
```

To run the program : 

```bash
./philo 5 800 200 200 7
```

The message is formated as follows : 
- [`duration_in_ms`] [`philo_id`] [`action`]

_eg:_
- _0 1 has taken a fork_  
- _400 3 is thinking_
